A LoL RTMPS server emulator that will provide extra functionality to the League of Legends client via proxy.

------------------------------------

Currently using the Oceanic certificate - requires a modified connection file to connect to the local server via rtmps & login server. Only gets to the main menu (will time out then show two popups - decline these two messages to see the screen below.)
